# CustomerReview
This five-part project was assigned during my junior year of high school in my CSA class. This project involved creating methods that was read reviews from a txt file and analyze them. Methods include one that copies the message, marking which words are adjectives, changing the adjectives, assigning a positive and negative score to the review due to the adjectives in the review, creating a star system with that score and outputting all of the information for the user to see.
