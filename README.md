This was a part of a 5 part project I was assigned during my Junior year of High School in my CSA class. 
This projetc involved creating methods that was read reviews from a txt file and analayze them.
Methods include one that copies the message, marking which words are adjectives, changing the adjectives, 
assigning a positve and negative score to the review due to the adjectives in the review, creating a star
system with that score and outputing all of the infomation for the user to see.
