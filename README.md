# CustomerReview
This five-part project was assigned during my junior year of high school in my CSA class. This project involved creating methods that read reviews from a .txt file and analyzed them. Methods include: copying the review, identifying which words are adjectives, changing the adjectives, assigning a positive or negative score to the review based on the identified adjectives, creating a star system with the resulting score, and finally outputting all of this information for the user to see.
